## For any consecutive even numbers in a series, if the number has a divisor two, upon addition of the divisor and quotient, a new series is introduced in the form of x, x+1, x+2, ..........
## Alternatively, for any consecutive even numbers (>2) in a series, if the number is divided by two, upon addition of all factors (excluding itself) forms a new series in the form of x, x+1, x+2, ..........

***********************
I came up with the idea when I was observing the Gilbreath's conjecture. (I am unsure, if the thing that I have thought upon already exists as a conjecture or not.)
***********************
An R code was generated using ChatGPT (modified by author) to test the first few even numbers (say 2:100)
[R]
# Initialize variables
start <- 2              # Start from the first even number > 2
end <- 100              # You can increase this upper limit
results <- c()          # To store transformed values

# Iterate over even numbers greater than 2
for (n in seq(start, end, by = 2)) {
  quotient <- n / 2
  divisor <- 2
  transformed <- quotient + divisor + 1
  results <- c(results, transformed)
}

# Check if the results form a consecutive sequence
differences <- diff(results)

# Print results
cat("Transformed sequence:\n")
print(results)

if (all(differences == 1)) {
  cat("\n✅ The sequence forms consecutive integers.\n")
} else {
  cat("\n❌ The sequence does NOT form consecutive integers.\n")
  cat("Differences between consecutive elements:\n")
  print(differences)
}
